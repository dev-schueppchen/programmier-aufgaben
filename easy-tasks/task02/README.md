## Numbers guessing

The programm should generate a random number, initially from 1 to 100. Then the player is prompted to enter: He should now guess the number. If he enters a number that is too high or too low, a corresponding message is shown. If the rigth number is guessed, the programm outputs this and exits.
If the number is not guessed, the programm should also be terminated after 10 attempts.

Conditions:

-   The number of attempts is set in advance
-   After a successful guess of the number or the remaining attempts have been used, nothing more should happen except for a corresponding message to be send.

### Additional tasks

-   You can choose the range in which the generated number lies
-   After a certain number of attempts you get a hint. Examples of a hint: _The number is between x and y._
